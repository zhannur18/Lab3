For the Stack implementations, I use the addFirst method to add elements to the top of the stack, and removeFirst to remove the top element. The peek method retrieves the top element without removing it, and isEmpty and size simply call the corresponding methods from the MyLinkedList or MyArrayList class.
For the Queue implementations, I use the addLast method to add elements to the back of the queue, and removeFirst to remove the front element. The peek method retrieves the front element without removing it, and isEmpty and size simply call the corresponding methods from the MyLinkedList or MyArrayList class.
